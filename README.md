This is a sample React Redux website that features:

-Graphs which can transformed into other graphs by clicking on them, such as going from seeing movie sales by genre to seeing the per-movie sales of all horror movies, and so on.

-Graph data and interaction are accessible for screenreaders.

-A news section which iterates over article data to show previews for all articles.

-Articles can be made of several different pieces which are loaded in order, allowing for reusable parts, such as reusing a graph or author introduction in several different articles easily. This opens up the potential for future interactive features, like hiding reused segments such as author introductions or terminology explanations for  already-familiar users, toggling more verbose versions of articles for interested users, or persistent editable graph data.


The data used for the graphs is currently not internally consistent, because it is a quick sample. This will change when the data structure and flow is reshaped to optimize for future features, once those features are selected and committed to.


Upcoming improvements include:
-Finetuning graph appearance for mobile.
-Adding forms.
-Adding features to make it more convenient to browse large numbers of news articles.
